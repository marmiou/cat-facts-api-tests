## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- You have installed Python 3.8 or higher on your machine. You can check by using 
```bash
python3 -V
```
- You have installed Poetry for dependency management. If you haven't, follow the installation instructions below.

## Installation

### Installing Poetry

Poetry is a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python. To install Poetry, run the following command:

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```
For other installation methods, visit the [official Poetry documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

## Installation

After installing Poetry, clone the project repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:marmiou/cat-facts-api-tests.git
cd cat-facts-api-tests
```
Install the project dependencies by running:
```bash
poetry install
```

## Available Commands
To activate the project's virtual environment and run the tests:
```bash
poetry shell
pytest
```

Alternatively, you can run commands within the virtual environment without activating it by using poetry run. 
For example, to run a specific test:
```bash
poetry run pytest tests/api/test_cat_facts_api.py
```

Or, to run all e2e tests:
```bash
poetry run pytest
```

Reports of the run can be found under the directory:
```bash
allure/reports
```

To open reports execute:

```bash
allure serve reports/allure-results
```
